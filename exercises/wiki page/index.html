        <p><b>Crown shyness</b> <i>(also canopy disengagement,[1] canopy shyness,
        [2] or inter-crown spacing</i>[3]) is a phenomenon observed in some 
        tree species, in which the crowns of fully stocked trees do not 
        touch each other, forming a canopy with channel-like gaps.[4][5]
        The phenomenon is most prevalent among trees of the same species, 
        but also occurs between trees of different species.[6][7] 
        There exist many hypotheses as to why crown shyness is an adaptive
        behavior, and research suggests that it might inhibit spread of 
        leaf-eating insect larvae.[8]</p>
