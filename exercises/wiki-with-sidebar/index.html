                     According to McMurtry, the motivation behind the car
                     was to challenge the industry trend of increasingly 
                     heavier vehicles and, by using first principles 
                     design, create a lightweight electric driver's 
                     car. The prototype car is the first step to 
                     demonstrate what customers will experience on 
                     road and track. It is not currently in a racing 
                     series but is built to satisfy relevant motorsport 
                     safety requirements, with crash structures and a 
                     carbon-fibre monocoque chassis with integral 
                     rollover protection. Its unique performance 
                     differentiator is the fan-powered downforce system, 
                     producing 2,000 kg (4,400 lb) of downforce at a 
                     standstill.

                     The car, developed in secrecy over three years, 
                     was first presented at the Goodwood Festival 
                     of Speed on 8 July 2021, and driven by Derek Bell.
