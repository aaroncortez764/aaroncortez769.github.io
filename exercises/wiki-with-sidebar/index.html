                <p>
                    The <b>McMurtry Spéirling</b> is an electric 
                    single-seat prototype sports car which was 
                    first presented at the Goodwood Festival of Speed 
                    in 2021. The car is developed by McMurtry Automotive, 
                    a British registered startup founded on 2 June 2016 
                    by Sir David McMurtry (co-founder and executive 
                    chairman of Renishaw plc). "Spéirling" is Irish for 
                    "thunderstorm".
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h3>History</h3>
                    <hr>
                    According to McMurtry, the motivation behind the 
                    car was to challenge the industry trend of 
                    increasingly heavier vehicles and, by using first 
                    principles design, create a lightweight electric 
                    driver's car. The prototype car is the first step 
                    to demonstrate what customers will experience on 
                    road and track. It is not currently in a racing 
                    series but is built to satisfy relevant motorsport 
                    safety requirements, with crash structures and a 
                    carbon-fibre monocoque chassis with integral 
                    rollover protection. Its unique performance 
                    differentiator is the fan-powered downforce system,
                    producing 2,000 kg (4,400 lb) of downforce at a 
                    standstill.
                    The car, developed in secrecy over three years, 
                    was first presented at the Goodwood Festival of 
                    Speed on 8 July 2021, and driven by Derek Bell.
                    In December 2022, it set the following times 
                    verified by independent GPS timing without 
                    rollout by Mat Watson from carwow on 
                    Silverstone:
                    <ul>
                        <li>0-97 km/h (60 mph) in 1.55 seconds</li>
                        <li>0-161 km/h (100 mph) in 2.63 seconds</li>
                        <li>0-233 km/h (145 mph) in 4.98 seconds</li>
                        <li>400 m (approx. 1/4 mile) in 7.97 seconds</li>
                    </ul>

                    When considering the 1/4 mile time, the car had a 
                    249 km/h (155 mph) top speed for roughly the last 
                    3 seconds of the run. The car also ran on 
                    bespoke drag slicks and was not a production car 
                    model.

                <h3>Specifications</h3>
                <hr>
            
                <p>
                    Below are the specifications for the 
                    Spéirling PURE:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Peak power output: 745 kW (1,000 hp)</li>
                        <li>Top speed: 298 km/h (185 mph)</li> 
                        <li>0-97 km/h (60 mph) in 1.55 seconds</li> 
                        <li>400 m (approx. 1/4 mile) in 7.97 seconds</li> 
                        <li>Weight: 900 kg (1,980 lb)</li> 
                        <li>Battery capacity: 60 kWh</li> 
                        <li>Rear wheel drive</li>
                    </ul>
                    Estimated driving time on a race track at a GT4 
                    pace is about 25 minutes.
                    The car has rear-wheel drive using two electric 
                    motors placed inside a specially designed 
                    "e-axle", and uses carbon brakes. The monocoque 
                    has room for a driver 150 to 200 cm 
                    (4.9 to 6.6 ft) tall. The battery is 
                    integrated into a separate safety cell 
                    inside the monocoque. 
                </p>
                <h3>Active Downforce</h3>
                <p>
                    A special design aspect of the car is its 
                    active downforce system without the use of 
                    large splitters or wings, by means of twin 
                    fans which provide an extra 2,000 kg 
                    (4,400 lb) of downforce from a standstill. 
                    This allows the car to corner at a G-force 
                    of more than 3g. When the fans are at full 
                    speed, they emit about 120 dB of noise.
                    The use of fans powered by separate motors 
                    to provide downforce was first conceived of 
                    by Jim Hall for the Chaparral 2J, a Can-Am 
                    car he designed, constructed and raced in 1970. 
                    However, the 2J was banned at the end of the 
                    1970 Can-Am series. A downforce fan system was 
                    also used in the Brabham BT46B Formula One car, 
                    which was designed by Gordon Murray. 
                    It won its only race, the 1978 Swedish Grand 
                    Prix, before the car was withdrawn from racing
                    by Brabham and the technology was banned for 
                    the following season.
                </p>
                <h3>Tyres</h3>
                <p>
                    The tyre width is 210 mm (8 in) on the front 
                    and 240 mm (9 in) on the rear, both on 19 in 
                    (483 mm) rims. This is modest for a sports 
                    car and is comparable with regular road cars 
                    which tend to have tyre widths from 195 to 205 
                    mm (7.7 to 8.1 in).
                </p>

                <hr>
                <h3>Goodwood Festival of Speed</h3>
                <p>
    On 26 June 2022, the Spéirling achieved a new 
                    Goodwood Festival of Speed hill climb record, 
                    completing the 1.87-kilometre (1.16 mi) 
                    course in 39.08 seconds with McMurtry 
                    test driver Max Chilton behind the wheel.
                </p>

                <h3>Upside Down</h3>

                <p> 
                    On 11 April 2025, the McMurtry Spéirling 
                    PURE Validation Prototype 1 (VP1) was driven 
                    upside down for 5 seconds by Thomas Yates, 
                    McMurtry Automotive co-founder.
