            <p>Elephants are the largest living 
               land animals. Three living species 
               are currently recognised: the African 
               bush elephant, the African forest 
               elephant, and the Asian elephant. 
               They are the only surviving members 
               of the family Elephantidae and the order 
               Proboscidea; extinct relatives include 
               mammoths and mastodons. Elephants are 
               scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, 
               South Asia, and Southeast Asia and are 
               found in different habitats, including 
               savannahs, forests, deserts, and marshes. 
               They are herbivorous, and they stay near 
               water when it is accessible. They are 
               considered to be keystone species, due 
               to their impact on their environments.
